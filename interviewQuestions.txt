🔧 1. Brush Up on Core Web Skills
Master the basics:

HTML5 – semantic tags, forms, accessibility

CSS3 – flexbox, grid, media queries, transitions

JavaScript (ES6+) – arrow functions, promises, fetch API, array methods (map, filter, reduce)

👉 Resources:

freeCodeCamp

MDN Web Docs

⚛️ 2. Strengthen Your React Fundamentals
Since React is preferred, focus on:

Creating functional components

Props and state

useEffect and useState hooks

JSX syntax

Handling events

Conditional rendering

Lists and keys

Basic routing (React Router)

👉 Bonus: Try building a small app like a To-do list, Weather app, or Blog viewer.

🛠 3. Learn How to Use APIs
You’ll likely need to fetch and display data. Practice:

Using fetch() or axios to call APIs

Handling loading and error states

Mapping over data to display it in UI

🧪 4. Practice Debugging and Testing
Use Chrome DevTools to inspect and debug

Console logs, breakpoints, network tab

Try fixing bugs in small React projects or on platforms like CodeSandbox

🔗 5. Get Comfortable with Git and GitHub
Clone and push repos

Create branches, pull requests, and commits

Write meaningful commit messages

Use .gitignore, .readme.md

Communicate clearly in messages or meetings

Share code via GitHub

Ask questions and show eagerness to learn

📑 7. Set Up Your Tools
Make sure your dev environment is ready:

Code editor: VS Code (with ESLint, Prettier, GitLens)

Browser: Chrome or Firefox

GitHub account

Portfolio or GitHub profile updated with a few projects

✅ Bonus: Prepare Mentally
Be proactive, not passive

Ask for feedback often

Show curiosity—read documentation, explore features, and offer ideas when appropriate
